Description: Package provides pipe-style interface for 'data.table'. It preserves all 'data.table' features without
              significant impact on performance. 'let' and 'take' functions are simplified interfaces for most common data
              manipulation tasks. For example, you can write 'take(mtcars, mean(mpg), by = am)' for aggregation or 
              'let(mtcars, hp_wt = hp/wt, hp_wt_mpg = hp_wt/mpg)' for modification. Use 'take_if/let_if' for conditional
              aggregation/modification. 'query_if' function translates its arguments one-to-one to '[.data.table' method.
              Additionally there are some conveniences such as automatic 'data.frame' conversion to 'data.table'.
