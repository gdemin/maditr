Description: Provides pipe-style interface for 'data.table'. Package preserves all 'data.table' features without
              significant impact on performance. 'let' and 'take' functions are simplified interfaces for most common data
              manipulation tasks. For example, you can write 'take(mtcars, mean(mpg), by = am)' for aggregation or 
              'let(mtcars, hp_wt = hp/wt, hp_wt_mpg = hp_wt/mpg)' for modification. Use 'take_if/let_if' for conditional
              aggregation/modification. Additionally there are some conveniences such as automatic 'data.frame' 
              conversion to 'data.table'.
